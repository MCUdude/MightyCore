 * Exercises in executing arithmetic code on a system that we can't count
 * on having the usual languages or tools installed.
 *
 * This little "C program" is run through the C preprocessor using the same
 * arguments as our "real" target (which should assure that it gets the
 * same values for clock speed and desired baud rate), and produces as
 * output a shell script that can be run through bash, and THAT in turn
 * writes the desired output...
 *
 * Note that the C-style comments are stripped by the C preprocessor.
